	</string>
	<string id="banditmerc_outfit_description">
		<text>The outfit of choice for the majority of mercenaries in the Zone, recently 'liberated' by bandits. This variation suffers from external damage, reducing the amount of protection across the board; however, whilst it is not only less costly, it is much easier to get a hold of.</text>

		<text>The CS-3b body armour is a suit originally designed by Clear Sky for combat during the faction wars, but has long since been re-purposed.

		<text>This early model of the Duty bodysuit is based on the Spetsnaz PSZ-9 body armour and modified for used in the Zone.

		<text>Guardian of Freedom</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svoboda_medium_outfit_description">
		<text>A modern Freedom model, more suitable to new stalker recruits who are used to simpler suits. Unlike its counterpart, the Wind of Freedom, this variation provides decent protection from anomalies and bullets at the cost of higher weight. Comes with a built-in artefact container.</text>

		<text>Sentinel of Freedom</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This stalker bodysuit with reinforced body armour made by Freedom craftsmen represents a good compromise between combat and anomaly protection.

	<string id="svoboda_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>Produced by Freedom specially for research in the Zone.

		<text>A stalker bodysuit worn by mercenaries in the Zone, painted in murky colours. The suit has a common presence amongst any mercenaries who have had experience in the Zone prior to becoming a part of the faction; nonetheless, its lack of resistance towards anything stronger than a pistol bullet makes it a seldom preferred alternative in comparison to other outfits.

	</string>
	<string id="army_outfit_description">

	<string id="military_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>The military variant of the exoskeleton uses heavier materials to improve bullet resistance, this version of the exoskeleton though heavy makes one feel like a tank.

	</string>
	<string id="st_helm_hardhat_descr">
		<text>A desperately outdated steel army helmet without any additions. It provides no protection against anomalies or radiation, but can deflect bullets. The helmet has never been particularly popular in the Zone outside of brief armed conflicts between factions, although it sees a fair amount of use amongst members of Clear Sky, usually being fitted with a respirator for the faction's missions.</text>

	<string id="st_helm_m40">
		<text>M40 field protective mask</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_helm_m40_descr">
		<text>The M40 was the result of a programme in the 1980s to develop a successor to the M17-series protective masks. The M40 was to be a return to conventional gas mask design with an external side-mounted filter canister, rather than the internal cheek filters of the M17, which were awkward to change, especially in a contaminated environment. The M40 is favoured amongst many factions, particularly the mercenaries, as while it may lack strong protection against anomalies, it makes up for this by providing moderate bullet protection.</text>
